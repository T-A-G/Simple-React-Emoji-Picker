## Difficulties

First difficulty was determining right package to implement the popup functionality. I ended up chosing react-tether because i found it the quickest to get started with because the simple documentation. If given more time I would do a deeper dive into pros/cons of different packages.

Difficulty finding tooltip that played well with react-tether. eventually decided to not include tooltip due to hacky implementation. I believe I would go with an implementation of [react-tooltip](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-tooltip). The issue i came across was the tooltip not working in Modal even with following the guidelines on their website. With more time however i believe I could implement this elegantly.
